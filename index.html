            <p>Chef Julio Gomez has always loved the culinary arts, a talent he inherited from his family, who already
                succeeded in the restaurant business. While Chef Julio initially went to college for business, he
                quickly decided that he had to pursue what he was naturally gifted at. He knew the work would be hard,
                but he felt he couldn’t lose — he knew his daughter Shelly, his “North Star,” was depending on him.</p>

                    <h3>Thai Soup</h3>
                    <p>Tom yum is probably the most popular and famous Thai soup out there, and for good reason. The
                        soup is served piping hot and the forward flavors are sour and spicy, thanks to generous
                        squeezes of lime and strips of fiery Thai chiles.</p>

                    <h3>Beef Steak</h3>
                    <p>A beefsteak, often called just steak, is a flat cut of beef with parallel faces, usually cut
                        perpendicular to the muscle fibers. In common restaurant service a single serving has a raw mass
                        ranging from 120 to 600 grams. Beef steaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or broiled.</p>
